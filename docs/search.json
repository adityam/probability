    "text": "3 Probability Space\nProbability is a measure of uncertainty or our belief that a particular statement is true. In this course, we will not concerns ourselves with how such a measure of uncertainty is constructed; rather focus on the mathematical properties that it should satisfy and the implications of these properties.\nMany everyday statements take the form: “The chance (or probability) of \\(A\\) is \\(p\\)”, where \\(A\\) is some event (such as “sun shining tomorrow”, “Team A winning a hockey game”, etc.) and \\(p\\) is a number (e.g., \\(1/8\\)) or an adjective describing quantity (e.g., “low”).\nTo mathematically model such statements, we need to model the sequence of events that may lead to the occurance of \\(A\\): this is called a random experiment; the result of an experiment is called an outcome.\nIn general, the outcome of an experiment is not certain. We can only talk about the collection of possible outcomes. The collection of possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space and denoted by \\(Ω\\).\n\nExample 2 What is the sample space for the toss of a coin?\n\n\nExample 3 What is the sample space for the roll of a (6-sided) die?\n\nAn event is any subset of the sample space. Some examples of events are:\n\nHead occurs in Example 2\nBoth head and tail occur in Example 2 (this is an event that cannot happen, sometimes called the impossible event)\nAn even number is thrown in Example 3.\n\nNote that events are subset of the sample space but not all subsets of a sample space may be events. The reasons are too complicated to explain, but the high-level explanation is that everything is okay for discrete sample spaces, but weird things can happen in continuous sample spaces.\nProbability (denoted by \\(\\PR\\)) is a function which assigns a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) to every event. This number indicates what is the chance that the event occurs. Such a function should satisfy some axioms, which we will explain below.\nFirst, to define a function, we need to define it’s domain and range. Let’s denote the domain (i.e., the set of all events to which we can assign a probability) by \\(\\ALPHABET F\\). We expect probability to satisfy certain properties, which imposes constraints on the domain:\n\nProbability of an impossible event (e.g., getting both heads and tails when we toss a coin) should be zero. Thus, \\(\\emptyset \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\nProbability of something happening (e.g., getting either a head or a tail when we toss a coin) should be one. Thus, \\(Ω \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\nIf we assign probability to an event \\(A\\) then we should be able to assign probability to “\\(A\\) does not occur” i.e., \\(A^c\\). Thus, if \\(A \\in \\ALPHABET F\\) then \\(A^c \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\nIf we can talk about probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, then we should be able to talk about probability that either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurs and both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. Thus, if \\(A, B \\in \\ALPHABET F\\), then \\(A \\cup B \\in \\ALPHABET F\\) and \\(A \\cap B \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\n\nThus, the domain of \\(\\PR\\) must be an algebra! However, when we go beyond finite sample spaces, being an algebra is not sufficient as is illustrated by the following example.\n\nExample 4 A coin is tossed repeatedly until a head turns up. The sample space is \\(Ω = \\{ω_1, ω_2, \\dots\\}\\) where \\(ω_n\\) denotes the event that the first \\(n-1\\) tosses are tails followed by a head.\n\nSuppose we are interested in finding the probability of the event that the coin is tossed an even number of times, i.e., \\(A = \\{ω_2, ω_4, \\dots\\}\\). Note that \\(ω_2, ω_4, \\dots \\in \\ALPHABET F\\). However, \\(A\\) is a set. If we want to assign probability to \\(A\\) in terms of probability of \\(ω_n\\), we require \\(\\ALPHABET F\\) to be closed under countable unions. This motivates the following definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(σ\\)-algebra\n\n\n\nGiven a universal set \\(Ω\\), a collection \\(\\ALPHABET F = \\{F_1, F_2, \\dots\\}\\) of subsets of \\(Ω\\) is called a \\(\\boldsymbol{σ}\\)-algebra if it satisfies the following properties:\n\n\\(\\emptyset \\in \\ALPHABET F\\) and \\(Ω \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\nClosed under complements: if \\(A \\in \\ALPHABET F\\) then \\(A^c \\in \\ALPHABET F\\).\nClosed under countable unions: if \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots \\in \\ALPHABET F\\), then \\[\n\\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ A_n \\in \\ALPHABET F\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Probability space) A probability space is a tuple \\((Ω, \\ALPHABET F, \\PR)\\) comprising of a set \\(Ω\\), a \\(σ\\)-algebra \\(\\ALPHABET F\\) on \\(Ω\\), and a function \\(\\PR \\colon \\ALPHABET F \\to [0,1]\\) that satisfies the following axioms of proability\n\n\\(\\PR(\\emptyset) = 0\\) and \\(\\PR(Ω) = 1\\).\nCountale additivity. If \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots Ω\\) is a collection of disjoint events in \\(\\ALPHABET F\\), then, \\[\n\\PR\\biggl( \\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ A_n \\biggr) =\n\\sum_{n=1}^∞ \\PR(A_n).\n\\]\n\n\nSome immediate implications of the axioms of probability are the following.\n\nLemma 1 (Properties of probability measures)  \n\n\\(\\PR(A^c) = 1 - \\PR(A)\\).\nMonotonicity. If \\(A \\subset B\\), then \\(\\PR(B) = \\PR(A) + \\PR(B \\setminus A) \\ge \\PR(A)\\).\nContinuity. Let \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) be (weakly) increasing sequence of events, i.e., \\(A_1 \\subseteq A_2 \\subseteq A_3 \\subseteq \\cdots\\). Define \\[\n  A = \\lim_{n \\to ∞} A_n = \\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ A_n.\n\\] Then, \\[\n  \\PR(A) = \\lim_{n \\to ∞} \\PR(A_n).\n\\]\nSimilarly, let \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots\\) be (weakly) decreasing sequence of events, i.e., \\(B_1 \\supseteq B_2 \\supseteq B_3 \\supseteq \\cdots\\). Define \\[\n   B = \\lim_{n \\to ∞} B_n = \\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ B_n.\n\\] Then, \\[\n   \\PR(B) = \\lim_{n \\to ∞} \\PR(B_n).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proof of parts (a) and (b) is elementary and left as an exercise. Part (c) is more technical and is essentially equivalent to countable additivity. See the textbook for a proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome terminology\n\n\n\n\nAn event \\(A\\) is called null if \\(\\PR(A) = 0\\). Null event should not be confused with impossible event \\(\\emptyset\\).\nWe say that \\(A\\) occurs almost surely (abbreviated to a.s.) if \\(\\PR(A) = 1\\)."
